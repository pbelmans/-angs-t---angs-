\section{Schemes}

In my previous post I introduced affine schemes, which will serve as the building blocks for schemes. Besides constructing schemes in general I will also say a few words on projective schemes, which can serve as another class of building blocks for schemes.

The second part of this post will be devoted to properties of schemes. I will introduce some of the more frequently occurring, so that we can understand them when they arise in \iftex\cite{mapping-fun}\fi\ifblog Mapping~$\mathbb{F}_1$-land\fi.
