\section{What are schemes?}

Or phrased more strongly: why the heck do we need them? I was perfectly happy with varieties!

Well, you might remember the following relationship from the first lecture of \#angs@t (or from our algebraic geometry course last year):
\begin{equation}
  \text{affine varieties} \underset{\text{equivalence}}{\overset{\text{anti-}}{\longleftrightarrow}} \text{reduced and finitely generated $\mathbb{C}$-algebras}
  \label{equation:variety-anti-equivalence}
\end{equation}
with the anti-equivalence being expressed by taking~$\mSpec$ and the corresponding coordinate ring. In case you haven't seen~$\mSpec$ before: it's the set of maximal ideals (of a finitely generated~$\mathbb{C}$-algebra without nilpotents in this case) equipped with a Zariski topology\todo{relate to notation from our course}. This anti-equivalence is not the definition of the theory in se, it is more a consequence of the construction.

The objects on the left are quite nice: we can easily make drawings of them (or at least of their counterparts in~$\mathbb{R}$), but to the right we find a set of (although nice) objects with severe restrictions.

We observe three mutually unrelated conditions you might want to relax:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the absence of nilpotent elements.
  \item finitely generated;
  \item only defined over~$\mathbb{C}$;
\end{enumerate}
As for now, we don't want to lose the fact that we're dealing with algebras (or rings).

By dropping these restrictions we wish to gain
\begin{itemize}
  \item elegance of exposition;
  \item the bliss of stating things in their most general form;
  \item a tool and a language when you have to work with objects that do not meet this stringent conditions (if you're a number theorist for instance, and we all are a bit for the course of this seminar).
\end{itemize}

Before I introduce scheme theory by giving the generalization of~\eqref{equation:variety-anti-equivalence} I'll discuss what happens if we drop each of the conditions:
\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{reducedness}] by allowing nilpotents we gain objects like the dual numbers, intersection theory now becomes an essential part of our language (or vice versa), \todo{more};
  \item[\textbf{finitely generated}] we'll get some nice counterexamples from dropping this condition, e.g.\ \todo{example?}
  \item[\textbf{$\mathbb{C}$-algebras}] we have been working with curves over \emph{finite fields} from the beginning of this seminar and you might want to work over \emph{no field at all} too, for instance if you want to give a meaning to~$\Spec\mathbb{Z}[x]$;
\end{description}

So by analogy we now \emph{define} (you might remember this anti-equivalence from that same first lecture)
\begin{equation}
  \text{affine schemes} \underset{\text{equivalence}}{\overset{\text{anti-}}{\longleftrightarrow}} \text{commutative and unital rings}.
  \label{equation:scheme-anti-equivalence}
\end{equation}

It is not immediately obvious why the right-hand side is the correct choice, but you've got to admit it looks like a very nice generalization. What this implies for our geometrical intuition for objects on the left is less clear.

I will try to back up this definition and develop some intuition for this in the upcoming posts, but for a real dive into examples of schemes I refer you to \cite{geometry-of-schemes}, \cite{foag}, \cite{red-book} or if you have a certain masochistic tendency \cite{hartshorne}. My favourite is \cite{foag} by the way, it has pretty pictures and it tells a lot about number-theoretic schemes too.

Up next: the complete build-up to affine schemes.
