\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

As the first attempt to student participation in the \#angs@t / angs+ seminar, I decided to tell something about the Mason-Stothers theorem. This is a statement for polynomials that is analogous to the major theme of this seminar: the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture. And more importantly: it is a real theorem, with an easy proof. Alongside I will give some facts annex trivialities about the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture.

The outline: in Section~\ref{section:introduction} I will first give the formal statement of the $abc$-conjecture, it is already given online in \href{http://www.noncommutative.org/index.php/the-abc-conjecture.html}{the post of the same name} but we haven't seen it yet in the seminar. For personal reference I'll repeat this, together with the promised trivialities. Then I will talk about the analogy, resulting in the Mason-Stothers theorem. To end the introduction I will discuss the history of both the Mason-Stothers theorem and the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture. In Section~\ref{section:statement-and-proof} I will give the theorem and the proof. To conclude I will give some consequences, mainly the analogon of Fermat's last theorem for polynomials.

\subsection{The $abc$-conjecture}

Let's get \sout{physical} \emph{formal}.

\begin{conjecture}
  \label{conjecture:abc}
  If~$a$, $b$ and~$c$ are coprime positive integers such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{equation:abc-equality}
    a+b=c
  \end{equation}
  then for~$\epsilon>0$ there are only finitely many triples~$(a,b,c)\in\mathbb{N}^3$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{equation:abc-inequality}
    c>\rad(abc)^{1+\epsilon}.
  \end{equation}
\end{conjecture}

The function~$\rad\colon\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{N}$ maps an integer to the product of its prime factors. So we have~$\rad\colon n=\pm p_1^{e_1}\ldots p_k^{e_k}\mapsto p_1\ldots p_k$. What this conjecture now tries to convey is: in almost all cases we observe~$c<\rad(abc)$. I will give some examples.

\begin{example}
  \label{example:abc-1}
  Consider~$4+127=131$. We have~$\rad(4\cdot 127\cdot 131)=33274$ because~$127$ and~$131$ are both prime. And it is obvious that~$131<33274$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  \label{example:abc-2}
  Now for an example of a triple such that~$c>\rad(abc)$, consider the equality~$3+125=128$. We have~$\rad(3\cdot 125\cdot 128)=30$, which is considerably smaller than~$128$.
\end{example}

So why is the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture this difficult? It's because we're relating additive structure (present in~\eqref{equation:abc-equality}) to multiplicative structure (present in~\eqref{equation:abc-inequality}). But maybe we could simplify the statement, dropping the~$+\epsilon$ in the exponent of the radical. We'd still be relating two different structures on~$\mathbb{Z}$ but at least it doesn't look like the~$\epsilon$-$\delta$-definition of continuity of real functions.

\begin{remark}
  The presence of an~$\epsilon$ in the exponent is necessary! If we drop it, reducing the exponential relationship between~$c$ and~$\rad(abc)$ to a \emph{linear} relationship, we'll get infinitely many~$(a,b,c)$ such that~$c>\rad(abc)$. I will now give a concrete example of an infinite class of counterexamples. For more general set-ups, please refer to~\cite{lower-bounds-abc-hits}.
  
  Take~$a=1$ and~$c=3^{2^k}$, so~$b$ is obviously~$3^{2^k}-1$. We need to determine how many factors of~$2$ there are in~$b$. Let's look at~$k=6$. We have
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      3^{64}-1&=(3^{32}+1)(3^{32}-1) \\
      &=\ldots \\
      &=(3^{32}+1)(3^{16}+1)\cdots(3+1)(3-1)
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  and every factor contributes a prime factor~$2$ but the second-to-last contributes two! So we end up with~$k+2$ times~$2$ in the general situation with~$b=3^{2^k}-1$. We obtain
  \begin{equation}
    \rad(b)\leq\frac{3^{2^k}-1}{2^{k+1}}<\frac{c}{2^{k}}
  \end{equation}
  because we can isolate the factor~$2$ from the radical knowing about its presence and dividing the remaining factors from~$b$. This leads to
  \begin{equation}
    \rad(abc)=3\rad(b)<\frac{3c}{2^k}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad c>\rad(abc)\frac{2^k}{3}
  \end{equation}
  hence for~$k\geq 2$ we have a triple such that the linear variant of the inequality is satisfied. We definitely need the presence of an~$\epsilon$.
\end{remark}

For some more facts, I'll introduce the notion of quality, which is a measurement of the relation between~$c$ and~$\rad(abc)$.

\begin{definition}
  For integers~$a$, $b$ and~$c$ define the \emph{quality} of the triple~$(a,b,c)$ as
  \begin{equation}
    \quality(a,b,c)\coloneqq\frac{\ln(c)}{\ln\left( \rad(abc) \right)}.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Now the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture has a nice equivalent statement using this notion of quality:

\begin{conjecture}
  There are only finitely many~$(a,b,c)\in\mathbb{N}^3$ subject to the conditions in Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:abc} such that for~$\epsilon>0$ we have~$\quality(a,b,c)>1+\epsilon$.
\end{conjecture}

If we translate Examples~\ref{example:abc-1} and~\ref{example:abc-2} to this new concept we end up with
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \quality(4,127,131)&=0.468\ldots \\
    \quality(3,125,128)&=1.427\ldots
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now you could ask yourself the question: how big can~$q$ get for any triple~$(a,b,c)$? Well, the theoretical answer is obviously beyond reach, just like the actual proof of the~$abc$\nobreakdash-con\-jecture, but  the distributed comping project ABC@Home is trying to get as much information from examples as possible, enumerating all triples~$(a,b,c)$ such that~$c<10^{20}$ and extracting information out of them. As of now, they are currently somewhere around~$c\approx10^{18}$ but refer to~\href{http://abcathome.com/data/}{\texttt{abcathome.com/data}} for more information.

We get the following table of highscores:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cllll}
     & $\quality(a,b,c)$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\\midrule
    $1$ & $1.6299\ldots$ & $2$ & $3^{10}109$ & $23^5$ \\
    $2$ & $1.6260\ldots$ & $11^2$ & $3^25^67^3$ & $2^{21}23$ \\
    $3$ & $1.6235\ldots$ & $19\cdot1307$ & $7\cdot29^231^8$ & $2^83^{22}5^4$ \\
    $4$ & $1.5808\ldots$ & $283$ & $5^{11}13^2$ & $2^83^817^3$ \\
    $5$ & $1.5679\ldots$ & $1$ & $2\cdot3^7$ & $5^47$ \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

which summarizes~\href{http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~desmit/abc/index.php?set=2}{\texttt{math.leidenuniv.nl/~desmit/abc/index.php?set=2}}. Almost one year ago, only 234 triples with~$q>1.4$ were known.

But this computational approach is only interesting for information gathering, as Gauss and Riemann (not quite the least mathematicians) once conjectured while working on the prime number theorem that~$\pi(x)$ (the number of primes below~$x$) is strictly smaller than the logarithmic integral
\begin{equation}
  \operatorname{li}(x)=\int_0^x\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\ln t}
\end{equation}
but it is proved\todo{reference} that there \emph{must} be a counterexample smaller than~$1.4\cdot10^{316}$ but up to~$10^{14}$ none have been found so far. And there are infinitely many counterexamples too.


\subsection{Consequences}

\todo{write about consequences of the $abc$-conjecture}


\subsection{The Mason-Stothers theorem}

Enough conjectural stuff, time for some \emph{facts}. Did you know~$\mathbb{Z}$ is an Euclidean domain?

\begin{definition}
  An \emph{Euclidian domain} is an integral domain~$R$ equipped with an \emph{Euclidean function}~$d\colon R\setminus\left\{ 0 \right\}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that for~$a$ and~$b$ in~$R$ with~$b\neq 0$ we have a division with a remainder, i.e., there exist~$q$ and~$r$ in~$R$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    a=bq+r
  \end{equation}
  and either~$r=0$ or~$d(r)<d(b)$. An additional requirement could be~$d(a)\leq d(ab)$ for nonzero~$a$ and~$b$ but it can be proved that every Euclidean function can be modified in order to satisfy this extra property.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  An Euclidean domain can be equipped with \emph{several} Euclidean functions. When there exists a single function we can call~$R$ Euclidean, but all scalar multiples suffice too for instance.
\end{remark}

But~$\mathbb{Z}$ is not the only Euclidean domain. The polynomials~$k[X]$ over a field~$k$ can be used too! Now take~$k$ to be an algebraically closed field of characteristic~$0$\todo{why?}.

\begin{theorem}[Mason-Stothers]
  \label{theorem:mason-stothers}
  Let~$a(X)$, $b(X)$ and~$c(X)$ be three coprime polynomials (i.e., not sharing a common factor) such that
  \begin{equation}
    a(X)+b(X)=c(X)
  \end{equation}
  then there are \emph{no} triples~$(a(X),b(X),c(X))\in k[X]^3$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \max\left\{ \deg a(X),\deg b(X),\deg c(X) \right\}>\deg\rad(abc(X))-1.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

The function~$\rad\colon k[X]\to k[X]$ now maps a polynomial~$f(X)$ to the polynomial of minimal degree such that it has the same roots as~$f$. Under the assumption of an algebraically closed field this is the same as removing the multiplicities of the linear terms. Can you see the analogy?

\begin{remark}
  My statement of the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture was phrased in terms non-negative integers, removing the need for a maximum over the values of the Euclidean function~$|\cdot|$. The post introducing the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture states the inequality in this more general form. In the statement of the Mason-Stothers theorem the presence of an Euclidean function is more obvious.
\end{remark}

But have you noticed it? The statement doesn't require an~$\epsilon$ and there are not finitely many counterexamples: there simply are \emph{no} counterexamples to the inequality! See Section~\ref{section:proof-and-consequences} for an actual proof. But first I want to throw some dates at you.


\subsection{History}

\begin{description}
  \item[1981] Wilson Stothers states the theorem in his paper Polynomial identities and Hauptmoduln but the theorem is not remarked upon.
  \item[1983] R.\ Mason rediscovers the theorem and publishes it in his book Diophantine Equations over Function Fields.
  \item[1985] Joseph Oesterl\'e and David Masser conjecture what is now known as the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture but might as well be (and sometimes is) called the Oesterl\'e-Masser conjecture.
  \item[2000] Noah Snyder, while still in high school, gives an elementary proof of the Mason-Stothers theorem in the paper An alternate proof of Mason's theorem, which I will reproduce in Section~\ref{section:proof-and-consequences}.
  \item[2006] ABC@Home begins its search.

\section{Proof of the Mason-Stothers theorem and consequences}
\label{section:proof-and-consequences}

\subsection{Proof}

Consider the statement of Theorem~\ref{theorem:mason-stothers}. We'll prove some lemmas first. We'll denote the derivative of a polynomial~$f$ by $f'$.

\begin{lemma}
  Let~$f(X)\in k[X]$ then~$f$ has a multiple root if and only if~$f$ and~$f'$ have a common root.

  \begin{proof}
    If~$f$ has a root~$\alpha$ of multiplicity~$n$ it can be written as~$(X-\alpha)^ng(X)$ where~$g(\alpha)\neq 0$. Now~$f'$ is given by
    \begin{equation}
      n(X-\alpha)^{n-1}g(X)+(X-\alpha)^ng'(x)=(X-\alpha)^{n-1}\left( ng(X)+(x-\alpha)g(X) \right).
    \end{equation}
    If~$n=1$ evaluating~$f'$ in~$\alpha$ yields~$ng(\alpha)\neq 0$ as we've assumed characteristic~$0$. Likewise~$n\geq 2$ yields~$f'(\alpha)=0$ because~$(X-\alpha)^{n-1}$ doesn't vanish.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  Let~$f(X)\in k[X]$ then~$\deg\gcd(f,f')=\deg f-\deg\rad(f)$.

  \begin{proof}
    Because we've assumed that~$k$ is algebraically closed we can write~$f$ as
    \begin{equation}
      \prod_{i=1}^m(X-\alpha_i)^{n_i}
    \end{equation}
    and~$\sum_{i=1}^mn_i=\deg f$. We now obtain
    \begin{equation}
      \gcd(f,f')=\prod_{i=1}^m(X-\alpha_i)^{n_i-1}
    \end{equation}
    so
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        \deg\gcd(f,f')&=\sum_{i=1}^m(n_i-1) \\
        &=\left( \sum_{i=1}^mn_i \right)-m \\
        &=\deg f-m
        &=\deg f-\deg\rad(f).
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

We are now ready for the actual proof. No need to develop an intersection theory on~$\mathbb{P}^1/\mathbb{F}_1\times\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of the Mason-Stothers theorem]
  We have
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      a'(X)b(X)-a(X)b'(X)&=a'(X)\left( c(X)-a(X) \right)-a(X)\left( c'(X)-a'(X) \right) \\
      &=a'(X)c(X)-a(X)c'(X)
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  by the linearity of the derivative.

  Now at least two of our chosen polynomials must be non-constant, otherwise the third by~\eqref{equation:mason-stothers-equality} is constant too. Assume~$a(X)$ and~$b(X)$ are non-constant, we obtain~$a'(X)b(X)-a(X)b'(X)\neq 0$ \dots\todo{finish this}
\end{proof}<++>

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Formal statement of the theorem
  \item Proof
  \item Consequences
\end{enumerate}
