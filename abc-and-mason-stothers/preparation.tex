\section*{Introduction}

As my first attempt to student participation in the {\iftex\#\fi\ifblog#\fi}angs@t / angs+ seminar, I decided to tell something about the the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture and the related Mason-Stothers theorem. The first has been hinted at but not yet formally introduced and the second is a statement for polynomials that is analogous to the first. And more importantly: it is a \emph{real theorem}, with an easy proof. I will introduce both, give facts about both and I will prove \sout{both} \emph{the latter}.

\iftex
The outline: in Section~\ref{section:abc} I will first give the formal statement of the $abc$-conjecture, it is already given online in \href{http://www.noncommutative.org/index.php/the-abc-conjecture.html}{the post of the same name} but we haven't seen it yet in the seminar. For personal reference I'll repeat this, together with some generalities about it. To end the section I discuss some consequences.

\subsection{The $abc$-conjecture}
\fi

Let's get \sout{physical} \emph{formal}.

\begin{conjecture}
  \label{conjecture:abc}
  If~$a$, $b$ and~$c$ are coprime (i.e.,~$\gcd(a,b,c)=1$) positive integers such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{equation:abc-equality}
    a+b=c
  \end{equation}
  then for~$\epsilon>0$ there are only finitely many triples~$(a,b,c)\in\mathbb{N}^3$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{equation:abc-inequality}
    c>\rad(abc)^{1+\epsilon}.
  \end{equation}
\end{conjecture}

The function~$\rad\colon\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{N}$ maps an integer to the product of its prime factors. So we have~$\rad\colon n=\pm p_1^{e_1}\ldots p_k^{e_k}\mapsto p_1\ldots p_k$. What this conjecture now tries to convey is: (for the correct notion of) almost all cases we observe~$c<\rad(abc)$,~i.e.,~a number~$c$ subject to the given conditions is almost always smaller than the radical of the product~$abc$.

I will give some examples.

\begin{example}
  \label{example:abc-1}
  Consider~$4+127=131$. We have~$\rad(4\cdot 127\cdot 131)=33274$ because~$127$ and~$131$ are both prime. And it is obvious that~$131<33274$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  \label{example:abc-2}
  Now for an example of a triple such that~$c>\rad(abc)$, consider the equality~$3+125=128$. We have~$\rad(3\cdot 125\cdot 128)=30$, which is considerably smaller than~$128$.
\end{example}

So why is the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture this difficult? It's because we're relating additive structure (present in~\eqref{equation:abc-equality}) to multiplicative structure (present in~\eqref{equation:abc-inequality}).

But maybe we could simplify the statement! Algebraists and geometers don't like~$\epsilon$'s so we could consider dropping the~$+\epsilon$ in the exponent of the radical. We'd still be relating two different structures on~$\mathbb{Z}$ but at least it doesn't look like the~$\epsilon$-$\delta$-definition of continuity of real functions.

\begin{remark}
  But no! It turns out, the presence of an~$\epsilon$ in the exponent is necessary. If we decide to drop it, reducing the exponential relationship between~$c$ and~$\rad(abc)$ to a \emph{linear} relationship, we'll get infinitely many~$(a,b,c)$ such that~$c>\rad(abc)$. I will now give a concrete example of an infinite class of counterexamples. For more general set-ups, please refer to~\cite{lower-bounds-abc-hits}.
  
  Take~$a=1$ and~$c=3^{2^k}$, so~$b$ is obviously~$3^{2^k}-1$. We need to determine how many factors of~$2$ there are in~$b$. Let's look at~$k=6$. We have
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      3^{64}-1&=(3^{32}+1)(3^{32}-1) \\
      &=\ldots \\
      &=(3^{32}+1)(3^{16}+1)\cdots(3+1)(3-1)
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  and every factor contributes a prime factor~$2$ but the second-to-last contributes two! So we end up with~$k+2$ times~$2$ in the general situation with~$b=3^{2^k}-1$. We obtain
  \begin{equation}
    \rad(b)\leq\frac{3^{2^k}-1}{2^{k+1}}<\frac{c}{2^{k}}
  \end{equation}
  because we can isolate the factor~$2$ from the radical knowing about its presence and dividing the remaining factors from~$b$. This leads to
  \begin{equation}
    \rad(abc)=3\rad(b)<\frac{3c}{2^k}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad c>\rad(abc)\frac{2^k}{3}
  \end{equation}
  hence for~$k\geq 2$ we have a triple such that the linear variant of the inequality is satisfied. We definitely need the presence of an~$\epsilon$ of extra space in the exponent.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Another viewpoint}

For some more facts, I'll introduce the notion of quality, which is a measurement of the relation between~$c$ and~$\rad(abc)$.

\begin{definition}
  For integers~$a$, $b$ and~$c$ define the \emph{quality} of the triple~$(a,b,c)$ as
  \begin{equation}
    \quality(a,b,c)\coloneqq\frac{\ln(c)}{\ln\left( \rad(abc) \right)}.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Now the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture has a nice equivalent statement using this notion of quality:

\begin{conjecture}
  There are only finitely many~$(a,b,c)\in\mathbb{N}^3$ subject to the conditions in Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:abc} such that for~$\epsilon>0$ we have~$\quality(a,b,c)>1+\epsilon$.
\end{conjecture}

If we translate Examples~\ref{example:abc-1} and~\ref{example:abc-2} to this new concept we end up with
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \quality(4,127,131)&=0.468\ldots \\
    \quality(3,125,128)&=1.427\ldots
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now you could ask yourself the question: how big can~$q$ get for any triple~$(a,b,c)$? Well, the theoretical answer is obviously beyond reach, just like the actual proof of the~$abc$\nobreakdash-con\-jecture, but  the distributed comping project ABC@Home is trying to get as much information from examples as possible, enumerating all triples~$(a,b,c)$ such that~$c<10^{20}$ and extracting information out of them. As of now, they are currently somewhere around~$c\approx10^{18}$ but refer to~\iftex\href{http://abcathome.com/data/}{\texttt{abcathome.com/data}} \fi\ifblog\href{http://abcathome.com/data/}{abcathome.com/data} \fi for more information.

We get the following table of highscores:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cllll}
     & $\quality(a,b,c)$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\\iftex\midrule\fi
    $1$ & $1.6299\ldots$ & $2$ & $3^{10}109$ & $23^5$ \\
    $2$ & $1.6260\ldots$ & $11^2$ & $3^25^67^3$ & $2^{21}23$ \\
    $3$ & $1.6235\ldots$ & $19\cdot1307$ & $7\cdot29^231^8$ & $2^83^{22}5^4$ \\
    $4$ & $1.5808\ldots$ & $283$ & $5^{11}13^2$ & $2^83^817^3$ \\
    $5$ & $1.5679\ldots$ & $1$ & $2\cdot3^7$ & $5^47$ \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

which summarizes~\iftex\href{http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~desmit/abc/index.php?set=2}{\texttt{math.leidenuniv.nl/~desmit/abc/index.php?set=2}}\fi\ifblog\href{http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~desmit/abc/index.php?set=2}{math.leidenuniv.nl/~desmit/abc/index.php?set=2}\fi. Almost one year ago, only 234 triples with~$q>1.4$ were known.

But this computational approach is only interesting for information gathering, as Gauss and Riemann (not quite the least mathematicians) once conjectured while working on the prime number theorem that~$\pi(x)$ (the number of primes below~$x$) is strictly smaller than the logarithmic integral
\begin{equation}
  \operatorname{li}(x)=\int_0^x\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\ln t}
\end{equation}
but it is proved that there \emph{must} be a counterexample smaller than~$1.4\cdot10^{316}$ but up to~$10^{14}$ none have been found so far. And there are infinitely many counterexamples too.

\subsection{Consequences}

Wikipedia gives a list of consequences ranging from absolutely stupendous important to nice facts about prime numbers. A short selection, which has been assembled based on my personal taste and understanding of the statements:

\begin{description}
  \item [\textbf{Fermat's last theorem}] Proved by Wiles in 1995 and with the overly known statement: there are no non-trivial solutions to~$x^n+y^n=z^n$ for~$n\geq 3$. An easy consequence of a proof of the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture would be Fermat-Wiles for ``sufficiently large exponents''. In case you wonder what sufficiently large means: we don't need an astronomical number like the bound from counterexamples for~$\pi(x)>\operatorname{li}(x)$, just~$n\geq 6$ will do (under a mild assumption). I will prove this below.

  \item[\textbf{Faltings' theorem}] Curves of genus greater than~$1$ over~$\mathbb{Q}$ have only finitely many rational points. This used to be Mordell's conjecture before, where Mordell is the one of Mordell-Weil fame (the abelian group of rational points is finitely generated).

  \item[\textbf{Infinitely many non-Wieferich primes}] A Wieferich prime is a prime number such that~$p^2\,|\, 2^{p-1}-1$. At this moment only two Wieferich primes are known: 1093 and 3511. There are three scenarios possible: both sets are infinite or one of them is finite. But a proof of the $abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture would only rule out the scenario where there are finitely many non-Wieferich primes, which by numerical evidence is \emph{quite} unlikely: it would imply that from a certain number \emph{all} prime numbers are Wieferich primes. I.e., the distribution would have to change tremendously.

    The notion of Wieferich primes relates to Mersenne numbers, i.e., numbers of the form~$M_n=2^n-1$. It is still an open problem whether or not all~$M_p$ with~$p$ prime are square-free. But if there would we a non-square-free~$M_q$ such that~$p^2\,|\,M_q$ then~$p$ is a Wieferich prime. So if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes (which is \emph{not} a consequenceof the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture) there will be at most finitely many Mersenne numbers that are not square-free.

    There is a distributed computing project devoted to finding Wieferich primes by the way: Wieferich@Home.

  \item[\textbf{Fermat-Catalan conjecture}] This is a combination of Fermat's last theorem as discussed above and the Catalan conjecture. As this conjecture was proved in 2002 by Mih\u{a}ilescu this name is outdated, but apparently calling it Mih\u{a}ilescu's theorem isn't common (which is obvious after writing his name twice). This theorem states that~$2^3$ and~$3^2$ are the only powers of natural numbers that are consecutive. More formally:
    \begin{equation}
      x^a-y^b=1
    \end{equation}
    where~$a,b,x,y>1$ only admit the described solution.

    Combining Fermat and Catalan we obtain that
    \begin{equation}
      a^m+b^n=c^k
    \end{equation}
    has only finitely many solutions where~$a,b,c$ are coprime natural numbers and~$m,n,k$ are positive integers such that
    \begin{equation}
      \frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{k}<1.
    \end{equation}

  \item[\textbf{Szpiro's conjecture}] Unlike the previous ones, this is \emph{equivalent} to the statement of the~$abc$-conjecture. Due to its technicalities (elliptic curve stuff) I won't state it here, but it's nice to know there are equivalent statements in a different language. The statement looks a lot like the statement of the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture so it might be questionable whether this approach yields many \emph{new} insights.
\end{description}

As you can see: there are both theorems and conjectures. Some conjectures have overwhelming numerical evidence while others are on par with the~$abc$-conjecture counterexamplewise. But now as promised, I'll give you a proof of Fermat's last theorem.


\begin{proof}[Proof of $abc$-conjecture implies Fermat for~$n\geq3\epsilon_0$]
  One can reduce the statement of Fermat's last theorem (but you should look at it as a conjecture now, whilst the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture has just been proven by yourself and you wish to earn hard cash proving Fermat's conjecture) to a scenario with~$x$, $y$ and~$z$ coprime.
  
  Now take~$a=x^n$, $b=y^n$ and~$c=z^n$. We have
  \begin{equation}
    \rad(x^ny^nz^n)\leq xyz<z^3
  \end{equation}

  Now assume that we have an~$\epsilon_0>0$ such that there are \emph{no} solutions to the scenario of the~$abc$\nobreakdash-theorem, which must be possible as any~$\epsilon>0$ admits only finitely many counterexamples so take~$\epsilon_0$ to be the maximum of the exponents such that~$c=\rad(abc)^{1+\epsilon}$ and add another~$\epsilon'$ to get a strict inequality.
  
  We obtain
  \begin{equation}
    z^n<(z^3)^{\epsilon_0}
  \end{equation}
  where~$z^3$ comes from the previous inequality, so Fermat's conjecture has now been proved for~$n\geq 3\epsilon_0$! Indeed, if~$n\geq 3\epsilon_0$ we have~$z^n<z^n$ which is a contradiction.

  It is believed that~$\epsilon_0\leq 2$ by the way. Now you just have to tackle some small cases, but these proofs are well-known (and rather easy, unlike Wiles' general version), for which I refer you to~\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem#Proofs_for_specific_exponents}{this subject's Wikipedia page}.
\end{proof}

\section{The Mason-Stothers theorem and a history of both}
\label{section:mason-stothers}

\subsection{The Mason-Stothers theorem}

Enough conjectural stuff, time for some \emph{facts}. Did you know~$\mathbb{Z}$ is an Euclidean domain?

\begin{definition}
  An \emph{Euclidean domain} is an integral domain~$R$ equipped with an \emph{Euclidean function}~$d\colon R\setminus\left\{ 0 \right\}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that for~$a$ and~$b$ in~$R$ with~$b\neq 0$ we have a division with a remainder, i.e., there exist~$q$ and~$r$ in~$R$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    a=bq+r
  \end{equation}
  and either~$r=0$ or~$d(r)<d(b)$. An additional requirement could be~$d(a)\leq d(ab)$ for nonzero~$a$ and~$b$ but it can be proved that every Euclidean function can be modified in order to satisfy this extra property.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  An Euclidean domain can be equipped with \emph{several} Euclidean functions. When there exists a single function we can call~$R$ Euclidean, but all scalar multiples suffice too for instance.
\end{remark}

But~$\mathbb{Z}$ is not the only Euclidean domain. The polynomials~$k[X]$ over a field~$k$ can be used too! Now take~$k$ to be an algebraically closed field of characteristic~$0$. This will be necessary: we'll split polynomials into linear factors and we'll use the first derivative. These will break in non-algebraically closed fields or fields with characteristic different from~$0$. What happens in~$\mathbb{F}_1$ is left as a trivial exercise.

\begin{theorem}[Mason-Stothers]
  \label{theorem:mason-stothers}
  Let~$a(X)$, $b(X)$ and~$c(X)$ be three coprime polynomials (i.e., not sharing a common factor) such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{equation:mason-stothers-equality}
    a(X)+b(X)=c(X)
  \end{equation}
  then there are \emph{no} triples~$(a(X),b(X),c(X))\in k[X]^3$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \max\left\{ \deg a(X),\deg b(X),\deg c(X) \right\}>\deg\rad(abc(X))-1.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

The function~$\rad\colon k[X]\to k[X]$ now maps a polynomial~$f(X)$ to the polynomial of minimal degree such that it has the same roots as~$f$. Under the assumption of an algebraically closed field this is the same as removing the multiplicities of the linear terms. Can you see the analogy?

\begin{remark}
  My statement of the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture was phrased in terms non-negative integers, removing the need for a maximum over the values of the Euclidean function~$|\cdot|$. The post introducing the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture states the inequality in this more general form. In the statement of the Mason-Stothers theorem the presence of an Euclidean function is more obvious.
\end{remark}

But have you noticed it? The statement doesn't require an~$\epsilon$ and there are not finitely many counterexamples: there simply are \emph{no} counterexamples to the inequality! See Section~\ref{section:proof-and-consequences} for an actual proof. But first I want to throw some dates at you.

\subsection{History}

For the actual overview I need a preliminary remark, restating the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture.
\begin{remark}
  \label{remark:abc-with-factor}
  We could also phrase the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture in terms of a constant~$K_{\epsilon}$. In that case we have for~$\epsilon>0$ the existence of a~$K_{\epsilon}>1$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    c\leq K_{\epsilon}\rad(abc)^{1+\epsilon}.
  \end{equation}
  Hence the constant~$K_{\epsilon}$ swallows all finitely many counterexamples of the inequality in~\eqref{equation:abc-inequality}.
\end{remark}

\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{1981}] Wilson Stothers states the theorem in his paper Polynomial identities and Hauptmoduln but the theorem is not remarked upon.
  \item[\textbf{1983}] R.\ Mason rediscovers the theorem and publishes it in his book Diophantine Equations over Function Fields.
  \item[\textbf{1985}] Joseph Oesterl\'e and David Masser conjecture what is now known as the~$abc$\nobreakdash-conjecture but might as well be (and sometimes is) called the Oesterl\'e-Masser conjecture.

  \item[\textbf{1986}] A first upper bound of~$c$ in terms of~$\rad(abc)$ is given by Stewart and Tijdeman. They proved the existence of a computable constant~$K_{\epsilon}$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      z<\exp(K_{\epsilon}\rad(abc)^{15}).
    \end{equation}
  \item[\textbf{1991}] Stewart and Yu improve the upper bound to
    \begin{equation}
      c<\exp\left( \rad(abc)^{2/3+K_{\epsilon}/\log\log\rad(abc)} \right)
    \end{equation}
    with~$K_{\epsilon}$ a computable constant.
  \item[\textbf{2000}] Noah Snyder, while still in high school, gives an elementary proof of the Mason-Stothers theorem in the paper An alternate proof of Mason's theorem, which I will reproduce in Section~\ref{section:proof-and-consequences}.
  \item[\textbf{2001}] Stewart and Yu again improve their bound, proving both
    \begin{equation}
      c<\exp\left( K_{\epsilon}\rad(abc)^{1/3}(\log\rad(abc))^3 \right).
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation}
      c<\exp\left( K_{\epsilon}\rad(abc)^{1/3+\epsilon} \right).
    \end{equation}
  \item[\textbf{2006}] ABC@Home begins its search.

  \item[\textbf{2007}] G\"yory and Yu improve a new bound on~$c$:
    \begin{equation}
      c<\exp\left( \frac{2^{10n+22}}{n^{n-4}}\rad(abc)(\log\rad(abc))^n \right)
    \end{equation}
    where~$n$ denotes the number of prime factors in~$abc$.
  \item[\textbf{2011}] We have a seminar about it, relating it to geometry over~$\mathbb{F}_1$.
\end{description}

\section{Proof of the Mason-Stothers theorem and some consequences}
\label{section:proof-and-consequences}

\subsection{Proof}

Consider the statement of Theorem~\ref{theorem:mason-stothers}. We'll prove some lemmas first, in which we'll denote the derivative of a polynomial~$f(X)$ by $f'(X)$.

The first is a well-known fact from one of our algebra courses, but for completeness' sake I repeat it:

\begin{lemma}
  Let~$f(X)\in k[X]$ then~$f$ has a multiple root if and only if~$f(X)$ and~$f'(X)$ have a common root.

  \begin{proof}
    If~$f$ has a root~$\alpha$ of multiplicity~$n$ it can be written as~$(X-\alpha)^ng(X)$ where~$g(\alpha)\neq 0$. Now~$f'(X)$ is given by
    \begin{equation}
      n(X-\alpha)^{n-1}g(X)+(X-\alpha)^ng'(X)=(X-\alpha)^{n-1}\left( ng(X)+(X-\alpha)g(X) \right).
    \end{equation}
    If~$n=1$ evaluating~$f'(X)$ in~$\alpha$ yields~$ng(\alpha)\neq 0$ as we've assumed characteristic~$0$. Likewise~$n\geq 2$ yields~$f'(\alpha)=0$ because~$(X-\alpha)^{n-1}$ doesn't vanish.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Now the second lemma, which is a nice statement about the number of roots when they are not necessarily distinct.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:number-of-roots}
  Let~$f(X)\in k[X]$ then we have
  \begin{equation}
    \deg\gcd(f(X),f'(X))=\deg f(X)-\deg\rad f(X).
  \end{equation}

  \begin{proof}
    Because we've assumed that~$k$ is algebraically closed we can write~$f(X)$ as
    \begin{equation}
      \prod_{i=1}^m(X-\alpha_i)^{n_i}
    \end{equation}
    and~$\sum_{i=1}^mn_i=\deg f$. We now obtain
    \begin{equation}
      \gcd(f(X),f'(X))=\prod_{i=1}^m(X-\alpha_i)^{n_i-1}
    \end{equation}
    so
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        \deg\gcd(f(X),f'(X))&=\sum_{i=1}^m(n_i-1) \\
        &=\left( \sum_{i=1}^mn_i \right)-m \\
        &=\deg f(X)-m \\
        &=\deg f(X)-\deg\rad f(X).
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

We are now ready for the actual proof. No need to develop an intersection theory on~$\mathbb{P}^1/\mathbb{F}_1\times\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$, only some polynomial manipulation.

\begin{proof}[Proof of the Mason-Stothers theorem]
  We have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{equation:key-equality}
    \begin{aligned}
      a'(X)b(X)-a(X)b'(X)&=a'(X)\left( c(X)-a(X) \right)-a(X)\left( c'(X)-a'(X) \right) \\
      &=a'(X)c(X)-a(X)c'(X)
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  by the linearity of the derivative.

  Now at least two of our chosen polynomials must be non-constant, otherwise the third by~\eqref{equation:mason-stothers-equality} is constant too. Assume~$a(X)$ and~$b(X)$ are non-constant, we obtain~$a'(X)b(X)-a(X)b'(X)\neq 0$ because if~$a'(X)b(X)=a(X)b'(X)\neq 0$ implies~$b\,|\,b'$ which gives us a contradiction.

  We now have that~$\gcd(a(X),a'(X))$ and~$\gcd(b(X),b'(X))$ both divide the left-hand side~\eqref{equation:key-equality} while~$\gcd(c(X),c'(X))$ divides the right-hand side. As~$a(X)$,~$b(X)$ and~$c(X)$ are coprime their greatest common divisors with the derivatives are coprime too, so
  \begin{equation}
    \gcd\left( a(X),a'(X) \right)\gcd\left( b(X),b'(X) \right)\gcd\left( c(X),c'(X) \right)\,|\,a'(X)b(X)-a(X)b'(X).
  \end{equation}

  By applying~$\deg$ to this statement we obtain
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{gathered}
      \deg\gcd\left( a(X),a'(X) \right)+\deg\gcd\left( b(X),b'(X) \right)+\deg\gcd\left( c(X),c'(X) \right) \\
      \leq\deg\left( a'(X)b(X)-a(X)b'(X) \right)
    \end{gathered}
  \end{equation}
  hence
  \begin{equation}
    \label{equation:gcd-inequality}
    \begin{gathered}
      \deg\gcd\left( a(X),a'(X) \right)+\deg\gcd\left( b(X),b'(X) \right)+\deg\gcd\left( c(X),c'(X) \right) \\
      \leq\deg a(X)+\deg b(X)-1.
    \end{gathered}
  \end{equation}

  We can now invoke Lemma~\ref{lemma:number-of-roots}, obtaining
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \deg\gcd\left( a(X),a'(X) \right)&=\deg a(X)-\deg\rad a(X) \\
      \deg\gcd\left( b(X),b'(X) \right)&=\deg b(X)-\deg\rad b(X) \\
      \deg\gcd\left( c(X),c'(X) \right)&=\deg c(X)-\deg\rad c(X)
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}

  If we plug these values in~\eqref{equation:gcd-inequality} we obtained
  \begin{equation}
    \deg c(X)\leq\deg\rad a(X)+\deg\rad b(X)+\deg\rad c(X)-1=\deg\rad abc(X)-1.
  \end{equation}

\end{proof}
