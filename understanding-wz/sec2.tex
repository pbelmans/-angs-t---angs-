\section{The objects}
In this section I will introduce all objects in the commutative diagram from the introduction. At the same time I will discuss the \emph{vertical} arrows. The third section will be devoted to a discussion of the \emph{horizontal arrows}~$\tau$ and~$\mathrm{s}_t$ (which are the interesting combinatorial isomorphisms) and some background to the structures we have discussed.

\subsection{The $\lambda$-ring over $\mathbb{Z}$}


\subsection{The Burnside ring of the infinite cyclic group $\hat{\Omega}(\mathrm{C}_\infty)$}


\subsection{The necklace algebra $\mathrm{Nr}(\mathbb{Z})$}


\subsection{The ring of big Witt vectors $\mathrm{W}(\mathbb{Z})$}
